# This is not a Notion Blog

### What is this?

You can use Notion as a content management system and combine it with Next.JS (and TailwindCSS) to create a blog or
other content website.

### What's the point?

There are many things I liked about Notion, including its flexibility, integrations and ease of use. However, while
Notion is great to work with, its pages are not aesthetically pleasing. Services allowing you to "publish" your Notion
Page have too many limitations at the moment.

In short, if you can make a pretty website, you can use Notion as well!

### Status of this Project

This uses the Notion API extensively. So, it is at least **Beta**.

**Features Roadmap:**

- Grab pages from the post database and render them.
- Grab the Main Page and render them.
